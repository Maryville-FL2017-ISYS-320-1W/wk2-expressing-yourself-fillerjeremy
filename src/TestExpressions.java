 	Your predicted values for the expressions
	1.8 -correct
	2.11 -correct
	3.12 -correct
	4.1.876 -incorrect. I think because Java rounds as it goes?
	5.1.68 Wrong. I think Java rounds up for that data type.
	6.11 -correct
	7.4+7  incorrect. It converted the 3 and four into text since the data type is a string.
	8.7+4 uhm. I really don't know how it's calculating this one.
 
 	After testing the expressions in the main method, indicate above if your predictions were correct.
